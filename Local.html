                            The percentage of illiteracy in India is alarming. Though 74.04% of people were counted as literate in the 2011 census, there is a wide disparity between rural and urban areas and male and female populations. The condition in villages is worse than in cities. Though a number of primary schools have been set up in rural India, the problem persists. Many people who are counted as literate can barely read or write. Hence, providing education just to children wonâ€™t solve the problem of illiteracy, as many adults in India are also untouched by education.atest data puts India's adult literacy rate[a] at 73.2 percent. While the country has made significant progress in improving literacy over the years, it continues to be home to 313 million illiterate people; 59 percent of them are women

                                    The population of India living below the poverty line declined from 37% in 2004-2005 to 22% in 2011-12 (Planning Commission data). In 2011-12, 22% of the population (one in five Indians) lived in extreme poverty. This figure is expected to decline to 5% by 2022, as per World Poverty Clock estimate. However, 80% of the poor in India live in villages. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh have the poorest areas. 43% of the poor belong to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe categories, as per World Bank statistics (2016). This disparity needs immediate attention from the government.

                                        Both men and women enjoy equal opportunities, but as far as freedom and safety of women are concerned, India lags behind. Issues like domestic violence, rape, the portrayal of women in media, etc., must be tackled immediately. Crime against women such as rape, acid throwing, dowry killings, honor killings, and the forced prostitution of young girls has been reported in India. Police records in India show a high incidence of crimes against women. In India Sati, Sabitri, Durga, Laxmi are worshipped by people treating them as goddesses whereas there is an increasing number of violence against women. Eve teasing, sexual harassment, rape, domestic violence against women are these weapons used by the male to display male superiority.
