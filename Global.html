                            Pollution is one of the greatest global challenges facing human beings. At least nine million people are killed by pollution each year across the world (The Guardian, 20 October 2017). It is also estimated that 1 in 8 early deaths in the world is related to air pollution alone. This number is likely to continue rising as more people live in cities and the world's urban population doubles by 2050 (Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants, undated). On the other hand, huge chunks of plastic have recently been found on Arctic ice, indicating how far plastic pollution has globally spread (The Guardian, 24 September 2017).

                                        Climate Change is the defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Without drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be more difficult and costly. Within the earth's atmosphere, accumulating greenhouse gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the gases within the atmosphere that absorb and emit heat radiation. Increasing or decreasing amounts of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere act to either hold in or release more of the heat from the sun.
                                        Our atmosphere is getting hotter, more turbulent, and more unpredictable because of the “boiling and churning” effect caused by the heat-trapping greenhouse gases within the upper layers of our atmosphere. With each increase of carbon, methane, or other greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, our local weather and global climate are further agitated, heated, and “boiled.”

                                      Overpopulation is a major cause of most of the world’s problems. Whether it is a question of food shortage, lack of drinking water, or energy shortages, every country in the world is affected by it – or will be.
                                      Partly thanks to the import of goods from abroad, any particular country is able to maintain its own welfare. But this cannot go on in an unlimited way. In fact, the number of inhabitants is rising in every country. The world population is threatening to rise in the next few decades to 8 or 10 billion. There is a good chance that more and more countries will need their own products themselves.
                                      Our planet can offer a quality of life comparable to that enjoyed in the European Union to no more than 2 billion people. With a population of 8 to 10 billion, welfare per person on a world scale will drop to that of a poor farmer who can scarcely provide sufficient food for himself and knows nothing of welfare. And thus we will have to share everything fairly in order to avoid disputes or war.
